                <li>Read a little everyday. Pick a time, a short book, a loved one, a pet, and read.
                    A chapter a day adds up. 
                </li>
                <li>Learn how to make healthy food - nutrient dense food that is going to 
                    fuel your body. Try out different seasonings and figure out which combinations work well together.
                </li>
                <li>Take initiative. If there's a project needing to be done. Go do it. Don't wait for 'xyz.'
                </li>
                <li>Take time to learn something new. There are tons of online, community, and other resources that are low 
                    cost or free. Teach yourself something - a new language, craft project, professional skill, and up your game.

    <article class="floatRight">
        <ul class="justifyLeft">
            <li>Practice meditation or breath/posture awareness. Spend 5 - 10 minutes sitting still and let your mind clear like rain.
            </li>
            <li>Take time for your physical health. Exercise at least 30 minutes everyday at least 5 days a week.
                Try a short yoga video online, walk around your block, maybe buy a bicycle for your place.
            </li>
            <li>Do something meaningful for someone around you. Give a family member a ride. Help them organize their kitchen.</li>
            <li>Turn off your devices and pay attention. There's lots going on around us. Let's be aware and present.</li>
